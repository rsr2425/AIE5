        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

BERT is a pretrained language model which was trained on massive amount of training data in unsupervised approach and it achieved astonishing results on different NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling, sentence classification, and words with multiple meanings [13]. Generally RoBERTa has better performance than BERT, to find the most effective model, we compared 4 different RoBERTa variants on Tensorflow: RoBERTa - base, RoBERTa - large, XLM - RoBERTa - base, RoBERTa - mnli.The whole model is consist of three parts, RoBERTa model, fully connected layers and activation layer. When the model is trained without fine-tuning, XLM-RoBERTa-base has the highest score of 0.595.', 'score': 0.046991114, 'raw_content': None}], 'response_time': 1.32})]\n",

The retrieved information is then used to inform or guide the generative model in producing a response. This approach allows the model to access up-to-date and specific information that it might not have been trained on, leading to more accurate and informative outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in applications where the model needs to provide detailed and factual information, such as question answering, customer support, and knowledge-based tasks.'"

This significantly reduces the trainable parameters of the model and the GPU memory requirement for the training process, which is another significant challenge when it comes to fine-tuning or training large models. To implement LoRA fine tuning with HuggingFace using Python and PyTorch, developers can use the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) library to inject the LoRA adapters into the model and use them as the update matrices. Removing this resiliency can make models less accurate, so the rank of update matrices can be tuned as a part of the LoRA process.', 'score': 0.902687, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': '[2106.09685] LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models - arXiv.org', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685', 'content': 'cs arXiv:2106.09685 LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models Hu, Yelong Shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.

It is primarily used with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini. The goal is to optimize the output from these models by crafting well-engineered prompts, which can lead to improved results and efficiency. This practice is crucial in fields such as customer support, content generation, and data analysis, where minimizing bias and maximizing relevance in AI outputs are essential.\n",
